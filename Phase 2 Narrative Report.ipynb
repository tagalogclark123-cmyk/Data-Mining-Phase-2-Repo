    "**1. Executive Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase, we established the foundational infrastructure for our data mining project. Our objective was to migrate unstructured JSON data from the OpenFDA Drug Shortages API into a structured, relational PostgreSQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "We successfully designed a normalized database schema that handles the complex one-to-many relationships inherent in drug packaging data. We then implemented a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python, ensuring data integrity through automated cleaning, type conversion, and secure credential management."

    "**2. Database Design & Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.1 Technology Stack**\n",
    "\n",
    "We selected **PostgreSQL** as our relational database management system (RDBMS). Its strict adherence to SQL standards and robust handling of complex queries make it ideal for the analytical workloads we will perform in Phase 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2 Schema Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data from OpenFDA presents a challenge: a single \"shortage event\" often affects multiple specific products (different dosages, package sizes, or NDCs).\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize for data integrity and reduce redundancy, we rejected a flat-file approach in favor of a relational design consisting of two tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `drug_shortages` (Parent Table): Stores high-level information about the shortage event (Generic Name, Manufacturer, Reason, Status).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `affected_products` (Child Table): Stores the granular details of the specific items affected (NDC, Presentation/Dosage).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.3 Normalization Strategy (2NF vs. 3NF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "We engineered the schema to be effectively in Second Normal Form (2NF). This allows us to link multiple products to a single shortage ID via a Foreign Key, preventing the duplication of general shortage details.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimization Decision:** We intentionally stopped short of strict Third Normal Form (3NF). While the `presentation` field technically depends on the `ndc` (a transitive dependency), we chose to keep them together in the `affected_products` table. This \"denormalized\" approach minimizes expensive `JOIN` operations during our future analysis phase, optimizing read performance for data mining tasks."

    "\n",
    "**3.1 Security & Configuration**\n",
    "\n",
    "To adhere to industry best practices, we decoupled our configuration from our logic. We created a separate `config.py` file to store sensitive credentials (API Keys, Database Passwords). This ensures our code is secure and shareable without exposing secrets.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Composite Key Generation:** Since the API lacks a consistent primary key, we generate a `shortage_id` by hashing the Drug Name and Manufacturer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Date Standardization:** The API returns dates in US format (`MM/DD/YYYY`), which conflicts with PostgreSQL's ISO standard. We implemented `pd.to_datetime()` to automatically convert these strings into valid Date objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case Sensitivity Handling:** We mapped all Python dictionary keys to lowercase (e.g., `drugName` -> `drugname`) to resolve conflicts with PostgreSQL's case-insensitive column naming convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.3 Loading Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented a **\"Refresh\" strategy** for this phase. To ensure our dataset is always current and free of \"Duplicate Key\" errors during development, our script executes a `TRUNCATE ... CASCADE`command before loading. This wipes the tables clean while preserving the schema structure and indexes."
